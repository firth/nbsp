There are several scripts that extract or process the data that is written
to the various files in

	/var/noaaport/nbsp/stats

Most of that data is displayed in several ways in the built-in
web server pages.

In addition, the folowing scripts can be used from the command line

	- nbspstatcounters
	- nbspstats

and the last minute data can also be retrieved remotely by a url such as

	http://<host.domain>:8015/_inbsp/stats

The two scripts are useful for local monitoring, while the web
interface can be used for remote monitoring.

Quick description
=================

- nbspstatcounters 

  Usage: nbspstatcounters [-f <fmt>] [-c <chstatsfile> \
                          [-q <qstatefile>] [-s <statusfile>]

Output the nbsp counters in the last minute. The counters contain
files and frames received, missing, errors and so on (statusfile),
the state of the processor, filter and server queues (qstatefile),
and the files and bytes received in each channel (chstatsfile).

If no <statusfile> is given the default nbspd.status file is used.
If no <qstatefile> is given the default nbspd.qstate file is used.
If no <chstatsfile> is given the default is <hh>.stats for the current hour.
The <fmt> can be: std (default), xml, csv, csvk
The motivation for the existence of this tool is to use it for extracting
and feeding the data to rrdtool or similar programs.

The <chstatsfile> is a log file of the inventory filter (not an nbspd file)
and includes received, for example, by external programs such as ldm or nntp.

- nbspstats

  Usage: nbspstats [-l <statsawkscript>] -q <statefile>] [-s <statusfile>]
                 [stats|qstate]

Output a "stats" summary report (stats) or the state of the
processor, filter and server queues (qstate).

If no command is given, "stats" is assumed. The -l option can be used
to specify an awk script for the "stats" report.

This script analyzes only the nbspd files (status and qstate) and
therefore is useful for monitoring the health of a receiving
noaaport system.

- http://<host.domain>:8015/_inbsp/stats

For example

  curl -s -S http://<host.domain>:8015/_inbsp/stats

will output the last minuta date in the same format as the
nbspstatcounters script. Similarly, 

    curl -s -S http://<host.domain>:8015/_inbsp/stats?format=xxx

can be used to retrieve the data in the same formats as described
above for nbspstatcounters (replacing xxx by the appropriate value,
csv, xml, ...). The data can be used to feed rrdtool or similar programs.
