Assuming that eth1 is the interface that is connected to the receiver,

1) Disable eth1 in NetworkManager

2) In rc.local

   SL, Centos (redhat clones)
	ifconfig eth1 <ip> pointopoint 10.0.9.54

   Debian
	ifconfig eth1 <ip> pointopoint 10.0.9.54
	route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth1

The value of parameter net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter should be 2 in order
to obtain correct support for a multi-homed system.
For example, as root, execute the commands

    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_max_dist=4096
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=2
