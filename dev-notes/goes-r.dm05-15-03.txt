SUBJECT - PRELIMINARY TESTING OF SBN GOES-R CHANNELS

GOES-R NOTICE 001

NWS WILL BE CONDUCTING LIMITED   PRELIMINARY TESTS OF THE
DISSEMINATION OF SIMULATED GOES-R IMAGERY ON THE AWIPS
SATELLITE BROADCAST NETWORK - SBN/NOAAPORT.   THE FIRST
TEST IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE THURSDAY  MAY 7  2015
WITHIN THE 14UTC THROUGH 21UTC TIME WINDOW.  THIS FIRST
TEST WILL INVOLVE DISSEMINATION OF A LIMITED SET OF
SIMULATED GOES-R IMAGERY PRODUCTS.  THE TEST PRODUCTS
WILL BE BROADCAST ACROSS THE NEW GOES-R WEST AND EAST
SBN CHANNELS /PIDS 107 AND 108  RESPECTIVELY/.   THE
SIMULATED IMAGERY FOR THIS INITIAL TEST IS INTENDED SOLELY
FOR THE PURPOSE OF TESTING DATA FLOW ACROSS THE NETWORK
AND IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED FOR SCIENCE STUDIES
METEOROLOGICAL ANALYSIS  FORECAST PURPOSES  OR
REDISTRIBUTION.

THE SIMULATED IMAGERY PRODUCTS WILL HAVE THE
FOLLOWING WMO HEADERS:
TIRAII KNES
TIREII KNES
TIRHII KNES
TIRPII KNES
TIRSII KNES
TIRTII KNES
TIRWII KNES
TISAII KNES
TISBII KNES
TISCII KNES
TISDII KNES
TISEII KNES
TISFII KNES
TISGII KNES
TISHII KNES
TISIII KNES
TISJII KNES
TISKII KNES
TISLII KNES
TISMII KNES
TISNII KNES
TISOII KNES
TISPII KNES
TISQII KNES
TISRII KNES
TISSII KNES
TISTII KNES
TISUII KNES
TISVII KNES
TISWII KNES
TISXII KNES
TISYII KNES
TISZII KNES

WHERE THE FIFTH AND SIXTH CHARACTERS /II/ WILL  IN THE
FUTURE  CORRESPOND TO GOES-R ADVANCED BASELINE
IMAGER /ABI/ CHANNEL NUMBERS  01-16.

A SECOND TEST WILL BE CONDUCTED DURING THE WEEK
OF MAY 11-15  2015.  THE SECOND TEST IS EXPECTED TO
INVOLVE SIMILAR DATA FLOWS  BUT OVER A SEVERAL-DAY
PERIOD.  FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SECOND TEST
WILL BE DISSEMINATED IN A SEPARATE NOAAPORT USER
BULLETIN. 

A SERIES OF GOES-R/SBN TESTS IS BEING PLANNED FOR
JUNE 2015 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2016.  IN ORDER TO ASSIST
USERS IN THEIR PREPARATIONS FOR UTILIZATION OF GOES-R
PRODUCTS FROM THE SBN   FURTHER NOAAPORT BULLETINS
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTICES AND NOAAPORT
USERS PAGE UPDATES WILL BE ISSUED TO PUBLICIZE
INFORMATION ABOUT THESE TESTS.  THESE MECHANISMS
WILL ALSO BE USED TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ABOUT
PRODUCT FORMATS AND HEADERS.  IN ADDITION  STATIC
SAMPLES OF SIMULATED GOES-R IMAGERY WILL BE POSTED
ON THE NOAAPORT USERS PAGE.

THE GOES-R SATELLITE IS SCHEDULED FOR LAUNCH DURING
MARCH 2016.  LATER IN 2016  FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY
GOES-R SATELLITE CHECKOUT  NWS PLANS TO ADD ACTUAL
GOES-R ABI AND GEOSTATIONARY LIGHTNING MAPPER /GLM/
PRODUCTS TO THE SBN.

DURING ALL GOES-R PRE-LAUNCH TESTS  THE SIMULATED
PRODUCTS ON THE SBN WILL HAVE LIMITATIONS.  FOR THE
INITIAL TESTS  THE TEST PRODUCTS ARE INTENDED TO
EVALUATE DATA FLOW ACROSS THE NETWORK.  THE TEST
PRODUCTS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE USED FOR SCIENCE
STUDIES  METEOROLOGICAL ANALYSIS  FORECAST PURPOSES
OR REDISTRIBUTION.  THE SBN S TEST AND OPERATIONAL
PRODUCTS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER
SINCE UNIQUE HEADERS /LISTED ABOVE/ ARE ASSIGNED TO
THE TEST PRODUCTS AND SINCE THE TEST PRODUCTS ARE
ISOLATED ON THE SBN S NEW GOES-R WEST AND EAST
CHANNELS.
