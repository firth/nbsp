# However this requires some sysctl settings that are not in the default
# kernel. See the file

# After the sysctl.conf.local file is installed, then the second
# udprcvsize setting above can be used (uncommented), or put in a file
# (e.g., udprcvsize.conf) in the subdirectory "nbspd.conf.d".

# Alternatively execute
#
#	nbspconfigure-dvbs2
#
# and it will carry out the steps indicated in those files.

# Source all .conf files in the subdirectory "defaults/nbspd.conf.d"
