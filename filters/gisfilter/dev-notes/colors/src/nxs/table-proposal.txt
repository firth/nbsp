This is the table I would like to use. It is a modified version of the
official one (table-orig.txt) in the entries for codes 7 and 8.
That would require the modifications explained below. They would
be more logical than the conventions that must bbe implemented
to keep this version of the table (in particular level=0 in code=8)

0, ND,    SNR < TH,        00 00 00, black
1, -50,   v <= -50,        00 E0 FF, light blue
2, -40,  -50 < v <= -40,   00 80 FF, medium blue
3, -30,  -40 < v <= -30,   32 00 96, dark blue
4, -22,  -30 < v <= -22,   00 FB 90, light green
5, -10,  -22 < v <= -10,   00 BB 00, medium green
6, -5,   -10 < v <= -5,    00 8F 00, dark green
7, -1,   -5 < v <= -1,     CD C0 9F, light gray
8, 1,     1 <= v < 5,      76 76 76, dark gray
9, 5,     5 <= v < 10,     F8 87 00, medium orange
A, 10,   10 <= v < 22,     FF CF 00, medium yellow
B, 22,   22 <= v < 30,     FF FF 00, yellow
C, 30,   30 <= v < 40,     AE 00 00, dark red
D, 40,   40 <= v < 50,     D0 70 00, medium brown
E, 50,   50 <= v,          FF 00 00, bright red
F, RF,   RF,               77 00 7D, dark purple

This would require a change in dcnids_decode_radials_af1f:

  static int nids_decode_srvel_codetolevel(int run_code){

    case 8:
      run_level = 0;
      break;

to

    case 8:
      run_level = 1;
      break;

Then in the mapserver templates, the portion

   CLASS
     EXPRESSION (\[level\] >= 0 && \[level\] < 5)
     STYLE
       COLOR [::nbsp::gis::radcolor $map(awips1) 0]
     END
   END

should be changed to

   CLASS
     EXPRESSION (\[level\] >= 1 && \[level\] < 5)
     STYLE
       COLOR [::nbsp::gis::radcolor $map(awips1) 1]
     END
   END

and finally in gis-colors-srvel.def,

  set radcolor(srvel,0) {118 118 118};

should be replaced by

  set radcolor(srvel,1) {118 118 118};

Analogous changes should be made in the corresponding rvel files.
