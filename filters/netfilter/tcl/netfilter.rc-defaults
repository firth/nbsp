# The two statements below allow to send everything
# to everybody, and also prevent the rest of the rules being checked. 

lappend cond {1}
lappend action {
  set allow(0) 1;
  break;
}

# If you put your own rules below, you must comment those two statements.
# If you put them in site/netfilter.rc you don't have to do anything here
# because the rules in that file (site/netfilter.rc) are executed
# after the rules here anyway.

# Note that this filter does not control what computers are allowed
# to connect to the nbsp process in your computer. It only controls
# what products wil be sent to each connected computer. On the other hand,
# nbsp is linked against "libwrap", the tcpwrapers library, and it uses
# is to determine whether or not to accept a connection. Thus, the
# /etc/hosts.allow file is used to control what clients can connect to nsbp,
# and the netfilter is used to control what is sent to each of those clients.

# This file is read only once, when nbspd starts. If this file is edited while
# nbspd is running, it can be forced to reload this file by sending a HUP
# signal to nbspd (it will reload all the other filters as well).

# Examples- 

# The rules are evaluated for each product and for each client.
# At the time that the rules of this file are executed,
# the "rc" variables that are listed in the file "nbspfilter.rc-ex"
# are defined here as well. In addition, the following two variables
#
# serverinfo(clientname)
# serverinfo(clientip)
#
# are defined and they are set to the client's fqdn name and ip, respectively.
# 
# The syntax for constructing the rules using tcl is explained in that file,
# with the exception of using the additional variables
#
#	allow(0)
#	allow(<hostname>.<domain>)
#
# explained below. 

#
# Default rules
#

# Having this as the first rule will deny access by default to every
# remote host, unless a specific allow(<remotehost>) variable
# is later set to 1.
#
lappend cond {1}
lappend action {
  set allow(0) 0;

# This does the opposite, it will allow all by default unless a subsequent
# allow(<remotehost>) is set 0.
#
lappend cond {1}
lappend action {
  set allow(0) 1;
}

# If the variable allow(0) is not set at all, it is the same
# as if it were set to 0.

# This is a way to allow, by default, all the computers
# from a given domain (e.g., noaaport.net)

# If the rule matched, the "break" statement prevents the

# the filter continues.

# Instead of sending all those messages, to restrict them only to those
# coming from the TJSJ station
